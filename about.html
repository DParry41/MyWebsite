Hi everyone! I'm Dale and welcome to Sim Racing Passion.
<br>
<br>

I have been playing video games for over 30 years and playing racing games since the very first Forza Motorsport, back in 2005. Unless you want to count 1992's Super Mario Kart (yes, I am that old!).
<br>
<br>

I obviously started on gamepad, but in 2017, I finally made a wheel purchase and have never looked back.
Don't let that deter you however. If you're a beginner to Sim Racing, the concept remains the same, with whatever method you've chosen.

<br>
<br>

This site is designed with complete beginners in mind, but can also be aimed at those who have dabbled previously and given up due to the struggle.
Trust me, the stress and frustration I had learning it was enough to make me want to give it up (and I'm still not the complete racer yet). 

<br>
<br>

So if I can help alleviate that stress and frustration for you, it'll all be worth it.

<br>
<br>

I basically started typing when the first lockdown hit in 2020 and ended up writing a 30,000 word beginner's guide to Sim Racing.
Instead of trying to redraft it all and try and go down the publishing route, I decided to try and implement it into an informative and educational website.

<br>
<br>
The website will cover everything you need to get you started and over time, I will update it to try and get you to the next level in your journey.

<br>
<br>

I hope it helps you.

<br>
<br>

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my about page.
