    Q1.  Describe the purpose of using IT in creating your website and how you will use IT to plan and carry out the necessary tasks.
    <br>
    <br>
    A: I will plan my website with the perspective of others in mind, instead of focusing solely on my wants and needs. 
    <br>
    <br>   
    To try and keep it as user friendly as possible. 
    <br>
    <br>
    It also needs to have a basic functionality to begin with, to get it up and running, with having an element of style so the user isn't off-put from entry.
    <br>
    <br>
    This includes fast loading of the web pages, as users can be put off by slow loading times.
    <br>
    <br>
    It's an educational website, full of information and resources for beginners.

</p>

<p>
    Q2.  Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete your website - explain what IT systems and software applications you need to be successful
    <br>
    <br>
    A) I used VSCode with CSS implemented as a method. I also used the very valuable resources of Codenation to complete my website.
